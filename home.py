## Code and Contributions

The code for this app is hosted in our Github repository. The code for the visualizations
is more-or-less directly copied from the notebooks we used to generate the figures for our paper.

Right now, the code for the visualization app is a mess with lots of duplication.
We hope to clean it up in the future, and welcome any contributions in that effort.
If you plan to customize the visualizations, the notebook may be an easier starting point.

While we think the interactive visualizations are important, unfortunately we do not have
the time to dedicate on-going support and improvement of this app right now. However,
we will commit to correcting any factual mistakes or adding clarifications where necessary.
If you are interested in contributing, please let us know (on Github), we would love to help get you started.
